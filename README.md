I developed this video streaming application, named VideoVerse, utilizing React.js for the frontend interface. The application features a sidebar for browsing through various video genres and a search bar for locating specific videos. It includes a channel detail page that displays detailed channel information and a list of videos associated with the channel. When a user selects a video, it plays within the main content area, accompanied by a sidebar presenting suggested videos relevant to the currently playing content.
